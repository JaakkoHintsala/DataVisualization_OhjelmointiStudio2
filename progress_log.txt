I started the project this monday. Most of my effort thus far has gone into figuring out how to use scalafx library in a proper manner.

Current objective:

Work out what is the best way turn a list of data to a column in a table. In Taulu.scala is my first attempt at it.
My vision is that after opening a data file, the program imports the data automatically to a table.
The user can then choose which columns/rows they want use in a chart.

I've decided to cut back on some of my other courses to focus on this
Currently I'm pretty happy with how fileMuunnin is working eventhough it will need to be revised in case I want to save different data types than Int2x.
My immediate next objective is to make it possible for the user to select colums/cells and make a new table/chart out of them.
